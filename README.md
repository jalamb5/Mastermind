Mastermind game

Built as part of The Odin Project to work on OOP.

Functionality:
- Player can attempt to guess a randomly generated code
- Player can set a code for the computer to attempt to guess

Issues:
- Computer's guess are really inaccurate and it rarely can correctly guess a code. I've attempted to improve this by adding weight to colors based on whether a previous guess included right positions/colors but this makes little difference.
